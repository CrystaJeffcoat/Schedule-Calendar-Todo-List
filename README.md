# Schedule-Calendar-Todo-List

## Description 

This website is designed to be a daily planner for the average work day. This application will store information entered by the user in timeslots and will be updated with the current time. 


## Instructions

```
When app is deployed, the current date will be displayed at the top of the page.

The calendar will be displayed below and will have a timeblock for every hour from 9am-5pm.

Each timeblock will have a background color that changes when the timeblock is past, present, or future.

When a timeblock is clicked, the user will be able to enter an event.

When the save button is clicked, the event for that timeblocked will be stored in local storage.

When the page is refreshed, the saved events will be in their timeblocks.
